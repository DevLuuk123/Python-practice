# Python Experiments

This is an open-source project where I experiment with Python.  
All code is public and available for anyone to explore or learn from.

## Features
- Small test scripts
- Small useless utils
- Experimental code


## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevLuuk123/Python-practice
   ```


## Wanna execute something?

If you got python already installed please do:
   
     ```bash
    python3 fun/bomb.py
    ```
    Or you can do this:

    ```bash
    cd fun && python3 bomb.py
    ```

## Got no python installed? No problem!
